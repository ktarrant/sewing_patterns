# Sewing Patterns
This is a collection of sewing patterns I have made using Valentina.

## Issues
I have had some issues with export function.
The squire outfit is too big to fit on a page so layout needs to be tweaked to use a larger page size.
The tudor hat uses 360 degree arcs which don't seem to work with the detail tool, preventing layout.
I have gotten around this by using curve tool instead, but it is annoying.
